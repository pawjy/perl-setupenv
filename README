Tools for Perl application environment setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* pmbp.pl

The pmbp.pl script is a tool to manage runtime environments for Perl
applications, built on the top of infrastructures such as yum/apt/brew,
perlbrew, cpanm, carton, and git.

  bin/pmbp.pl
  doc/pmbp.txt
  doc/pmbp-tutorial.pod
  Makefile.pmbp.example

Install the pmbp.pl into ./local/bin:

  $ curl https://wakaba.github.io/packages/pmbp | sh

Then, prepare a Makefile by, e.g.:

  $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wakaba/perl-setupenv/master/Makefile.pmbp.example > Makefile

Now, you can run the pmbp.pl script to install your application's dependencies into ./local/ by:

  $ make deps

If you want to run a Perl application on Heroku, see also <https://github.com/wakaba/heroku-buildpack-perl-pmbp>.
